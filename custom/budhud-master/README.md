### Notes Regarding budhud Customization
- In other huds, a majority of the files you edit are located in the root hud directory under `resource` and `scripts`. In budhud, this only applies to scheme and animation files. A majority of the files you'll want to edit will be located within the `..\budhud\_budhud\` directory.
- Because of the structure of the HUD, I would not advise people to use it as a base for their own custom HUDs. Though it is certainly possible, it requires a fairly deep understanding of hud editing and #base to be properly executed upon.
